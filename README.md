# CS101LassoGame_1stSem
Contained here are the codes I used for making a "lasso game" as part of my project in the CS101 course. This uses the graphics software "simplecpp", installation instructions of which have also been added in simplecpp.zip.
The zip file is if you want to download my code without forking/cloning the repo, the folder is if you just wanna view the code.
